# Stock Market Crash Maze — Christina Jordan

## Rules:
Use ONLY the command line to find the hidden solution file.

Do not use Finder or a file explorer.

Helpful commands:
- ls     → lists files and folders
- cd     → moves between folders
- cat    → displays file contents
- pwd    → shows current location
- ls -la → shows hidden files

## To get started:
1. Unzip the maze folder.
2. Enter:
   cd stock_market_crash_maze/entrance
3. Run:
   cat start.txt

Good luck navigating economic history.
